**CleanCred** is a civic technology platform and municipal incentive engine designed for Smart India Hackathon (SIH). It turns household waste segregation into an auditable, fraud-resistant civic game. By combining multimodal vision AI (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash), geospatial proximity verification ($\le$ 50m Haversine gate), one-time dynamic QR physical handoff, and an immutable double-entry credit ledger (100 Credits = ₹10 INR), CleanCred ensures that municipal rewards are only distributed when segregated waste is physically collected and verified on the ground.

## 5-Stage Verification Lifecycle

CleanCred strictly enforces a 5-stage sequential chain of custody before awarding any civic credits:

```
[ Citizen: Report ] ────────► [ Multimodal AI Verify ]
 (Photo + Geo-coords)          (Gemini 2.5 Flash Vision)
                                        │
                                        ▼
[ Citizen Earns Credits ] ◄─── [ Physical QR Collect ] ◄─── [ Worker Proximity Verify ]
 (Immutable Ledger Entry)       (Dynamic Token Burn)         (GPS Gate <= 50m + Sorting)
```

1. **REPORT (Citizen Submission)**: The citizen snaps real-time waste evidence using the in-app WebRTC camera or file picker. The client captures high-resolution imagery and current geolocation.
2. **AI VERIFY (Computer Vision)**: Backend inspects raw image bytes via Gemini 2.5 Flash (or `DEMO_AI_MODE` fallback) to categorize waste (`WET`, `DRY`, `HAZARDOUS`), evaluate segregation purity, and reject fraudulent/stock photos via SHA-256 binary deduplication.
3. **WORKER VERIFY (Proximity & Physical Check)**: A municipal collector arrives on site. The backend enforces a strict Haversine distance hard gate ($\le$ 50m) between the worker's live coordinates and the citizen's report location before physical segregation inspection can be submitted.
4. **COLLECT (Physical Custody Handoff)**: The citizen displays a dynamic one-time QR code. The worker scans it with the in-app camera scanner. The cryptographic token is verified via constant-time HMAC comparison and burned to prevent replay attacks.
5. **EARN (Double-Entry Ledger Settlement)**: The database records an idempotent credit transaction, and clean credits are added to the citizen's wallet, convertible to INR civic rewards or municipal utility tax rebates.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

CleanCred includes both sub-second pure-logic unit tests and a full automated end-to-end integration and anti-fraud test suite.

### 1. Pure-Logic Unit Tests (`pytest`)

Executes 12 unit tests covering spherical distance calculations, cryptographic hashes, and fraud scoring:

```bash
python -m pytest backend/tests -v
```

Expected output: `12 passed in < 0.15s`

### 2. End-to-End Integration & Anti-Fraud Suite (`verify_e2e_v3.py`)

Executes 14 end-to-end operational scenarios against the running FastAPI daemon:

```bash
python verify_e2e_v3.py
```

Validates:
1. `GET /health` operational status
2. Multi-role PIN authentication (`1234`, `5678`, `9999`)
3. Citizen multipart report submission with SHA-256 evidence hashing
4. Duplicate evidence rejection (Anti-Fraud Gate 1)
5. Out-of-bounds GPS verification rejection (> 50m Haversine gate)
6. Valid worker proximity verification ($\le$ 50m)
7. Fake QR token collection rejection (Anti-Fraud Gate 2)
8. Worker GPS collection gate enforcement
9. Successful QR collection & token burn
10. QR replay attack prevention (Anti-Fraud Gate 3)
11. Double-entry credit ledger credit award
12. 5-Stage report timeline audit trail
13. Citizen wallet balance reconciliation
14. Municipal analytics aggregation & hotspot detection

## Real-World Limitations & Production Roadmap

- **Computer Vision Model**: In production, the system connects directly to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via `GEMINI_API_KEY`. When offline or for zero-cost local evaluation, `DEMO_AI_MODE=1` activates a deterministic heuristic fallback.
- **Digital Scales**: Waste weights are currently reported by the citizen and audited by the worker during physical inspection. Production deployment integrates Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) smart municipal scales directly with the worker handheld terminal.
- **Relational Storage**: The prototype utilizes SQLite in Write-Ahead Logging (`WAL`) mode with foreign key constraints. For high-throughput multi-ward municipal deployment, the database connection layer is designed for drop-in migration to PostgreSQL with PostGIS geospatial indexing.
- **Evidence Storage**: Images are stored on the local filesystem under `backend/uploads/`. Production architecture targets private S3-compatible object storage with signed ephemeral URLs.
